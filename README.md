## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a machine learning researcher and developer passionate about solving real-world problems at the intersection of AI, healthcare, and hardware. Currently at UC Berkeley, I bring a multidisciplinary background in computer science, chemical biology, and mathematics to build intelligent systems with practical impact.

My experience spans:

- 🧠 Applied ML research in medicine (UCSF, Anwar Lab)
- 🏥 Building GenAI agentic pipelines for clinical + financial domains (Accenture x NVIDIA)
- 🔬 Signal processing and neural imaging pipelines for implantable biomedical devices
- ⚙️ AI-first EDA tools for chip design (ChipChat - Hackathon Winner + patent-pending)

I love combining deep tech with systems-level thinking to build tools that push boundaries—from reinforcement learning for anesthesia dosing, to CNNs for 3D tumor reconstruction, to Verilog-generating LLMs.

## 🧪 Current Research

- **Anesthesia RL System** – Reinforcement learning agent trained on patient vitals to optimize anesthesia dosage in real-time (UCSF AI Lab). Outperforms physician baselines in 95% of test cases.
- **Real-Time Tumor Imaging** – Developing 3D CNN architectures and optical sensor fusion methods for intraoperative cancer environment mapping (Prof. Mekhail Anwar's Lab @ Berkeley EECS).
- **GenAI Agents @ Accenture** – Creating scalable LLM pipelines for claims analysis and clinical support tools, optimizing healthcare and finance workflows in collaboration with NVIDIA.
